## **Avoid Referring to Documentation for These Topics**
- **Label and Annotate Resources**:
  - Practice commands to label and annotate resources efficiently.
- **On-the-Spot Resource Editing**:
  - Use `kubectl set` and `kubectl edit` to modify resources directly.
- **Resource Creation**:
  - Create deployments, pods, and jobs from the command line.
- **Expose Deployments**:
  - Use services to expose deployments.
- **Secret and ConfigMap Creation**:
  - Create secrets, ConfigMaps, service accounts, and other basic resources directly from the CLI.

## **Pro Tips**
- **Practice Makes Perfect**:
  - Rehearse frequently used commands until they become second nature.
- **Time Management**:
  - Quickly determine what can be done via the CLI versus what requires documentation lookup.
- **Stay Organized**:
  - Keep your workspace and notes tidy to avoid confusion during the exam.
