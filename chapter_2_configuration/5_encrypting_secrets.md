We are going to focus how this data us stored in etcd server?

Follow below steps to install etcdctl in playground or vm
To install the etcdctl client on a system that uses apt (like Ubuntu or Debian), follow these steps:

âœ… Step-by-step: Install etcdctl
etcdctl is part of the etcd package â€” but not available via apt directly. You'll need to download the binary.

1. Download the latest etcd release
bash
Copy
Edit
ETCD_VER=v3.5.12

curl -L https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/${ETCD_VER}/etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o etcd.tar.gz
2. Extract the tarball
bash
Copy
Edit
tar xzvf etcd.tar.gz
cd etcd-${ETCD_VER}-linux-amd64
3. Move the binaries to /usr/local/bin
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mv etcdctl /usr/local/bin/
Optional: you can also move etcd if you're running an etcd server locally.

ðŸ§ª Confirm it's working
bash
Copy
Edit
etcdctl version
You should see something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
etcdctl version: 3.5.12
API version: 3.5

etcdctl is for cluster administrators who:

Run their own Kubernetes clusters (e.g., using kubeadm, bare metal, or on cloud VMs),

Manage their own etcd (the Kubernetes backing store),

Want to directly interact with etcd for:

Taking backups

Restoring from disaster

Inspecting or debugging cluster state at a low level
