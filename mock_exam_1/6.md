# Mock Exam 1 - Question 6

## Question 6: Pod Debugging

On cluster3, in the `dev-001` namespace, one of the interns deployed one web application called `news-apd`.

After successfully deploying on the worker node, we start getting alerts about the pod crashing.

We want you to inspect the `dev-001` namespace and fix those issues.

### Solution:

```bash
root@student-node ~ ✖ k get pod news-apd-74945cfbd-rp4vk -n dev-001 -o yaml > news-apd.yaml

root@student-node ~ ➜  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=dev-001
Context "cluster3" modified.

root@student-node ~ ➜  k logs news-apd-74945cfbd-64slc
sh: sleeeep: not found
```

Fix the deployment by editing it:

```bash
kubectl edit deploy news-apd -o yaml -n dev-001
```

Then automatically fixes the issue:

```bash
k edit deployment news-apd -n dev-001
```
