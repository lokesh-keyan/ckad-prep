# Multi-Container Pod Design Patterns

## Overview

There are three main design patterns for multi-container pods:

1. **Co-located containers**
2. **Regular init containers**
3. **Sidecar containers**

---

## Co-located Containers

Co-located containers start at the same time and terminate at the same time. They share the same lifecycle and are useful when containers need to work together as a cohesive unit.

**Characteristics:**
- Simultaneous startup and shutdown
- Shared network namespace
- Shared storage volumes
- Equal lifecycle management

---

## Regular Init Containers

Regular init containers start and finish running before the main containers run. They are used for initialization tasks, setup operations, or prerequisite checks.

**Use Cases:**
- Database schema initialization
- Configuration file generation
- Dependency verification
- Security setup

**Execution Flow:**
1. Init containers run sequentially
2. Each init container must complete successfully
3. Main containers start only after all init containers finish

---

## Sidecar Containers

Sidecar containers are similar to co-located containers, but we have more control over which container starts first. They extend or enhance the functionality of the main application container.

**Common Patterns:**
- Logging agents
- Monitoring tools
- Security proxies
- Configuration managers

## Example: Pod with Init Container

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp-pod
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp-container
    image: busybox:1.28
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo The app is running! && sleep 3600']
  initContainers:
  - name: init-myservice
    image: busybox
    command: ['sh', '-c', 'git clone <repository-url>']
```

**Key Points:**
- The `initContainers` section defines containers that run before the main containers
- Init containers run sequentially and must complete successfully
- Main containers start only after all init containers finish
- Useful for setup tasks, dependency checks, and initialization operations
