# Mock Exam 2 - Question 3

## Question 3: Job Creation with Alpine Image

In the `ckad-job` namespace, create a job called `alpine-job` that runs `top` command inside the container; use `alpine` image for this task.

### Solution:

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: alpine-job
  namespace: ckad-job
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: alpine
        image: alpine
        command: ["top"]        # ðŸ‘ˆ run top command
      restartPolicy: Never 
```

## Understanding Command Execution in Kubernetes

### Case 1: When you don't need `/bin/sh -c`

If the command you want to run is a binary directly available in the container's PATH, you can specify it directly:

```yaml
command: ["top"]
```

Kubernetes runs `/usr/bin/top` (or wherever it lives in Alpine).

No shell is needed because `top` is already an executable program.

### Alternative Imperative Command:

```bash
kubectl create job alpine-job --image=alpine -n ckad-job --dry-run=client -o yaml > job.yaml
# Then edit the YAML to add the command: ["top"]
kubectl apply -f job.yaml
```
