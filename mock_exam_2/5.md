# Mock Exam 2 - Question 5

## Question 5: Deployment Scaling Management

On cluster2, we are getting alerts for the resource consumption for the `ultra-apd` namespace. A limit is set for the `ultra-apd` namespace; if the limit is crossed, we will get the alerts.

After inspecting the namespace, the team found that the deployment scaled to 8, which is wrong.

The team wants you to decrease the deployment to 4.

### Solution:

#### Step 1: Check Current Deployment Status

```bash
root@student-node ~ ➜  k get deployments -n ultra-apd
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ultra-deploy-apd   8/8     8            8           30s
```

#### Step 2: Scale Down the Deployment

```bash
root@student-node ~ ➜  k edit deployment ultra-deploy-apd -n ultra-apd
deployment.apps/ultra-deploy-apd edited
```

#### Step 3: Verify the Scaling

```bash
root@student-node ~ ➜  k get deployments -n ultra-apd
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ultra-deploy-apd   4/4     4            4           57s
```

### Alternative Solution (Imperative Command):

```bash
kubectl scale deployment ultra-deploy-apd --replicas=4 -n ultra-apd
```
